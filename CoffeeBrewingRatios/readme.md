# Coffee Brewing Ratios

I wanted to practice SwiftUI with the 100 Days of SwiftUI course by Paul Hudson and at the same time have some fun and do something useful.
This little coffee app has been inspired by James Hoffman YouTube video about [Brewing Ratios](https://youtu.be/ipB6P1uzNYM).

In terms of filter coffee like a pour-over or an AeroPress, how much coffee should I use?

Using the grams per litre ratio is perhaps the most convenient.
There are several different ways to measure coffee and the most
common one still are scoops, but it is not a good idea. 
There's no international standard for scoops which are volumetric measurements and they'll have massive fluctuations in actual weight. 

The other commonly used ratios systems are 1/14, 1/15... It means 1 part of coffee to n parts of water.
But if I have a desired amount of coffee that I want to brew and I want to work out how much ground coffee I need, the grams per litre ratio is the most useful way to go.  Let's say, I'm brewing half a litre with a 60grams a litre ratio, then I know I need half that, which is 30 grams.

A pretty good one-size-fits-all ratio is 60 grams per litre but you can choose others like 55 or 75 per litre. That's up to you.

One factor in the world of coffee brewing is extraction.
In coffee about approximately a third of it is soluble material. Two-thirds of it is pretty much insoluble. It's cellulose. You could steep that coffee forever and still have some grounds leftover. It would not taste very nice though.

The best taste is with around 20-22% extraction.
Once you're really happy with the taste you can change the ratio or the strength. The strength of my cup of coffee it's a personal thing.

We divide coffee brewing into percolation and infusion.
With percolation water is passing through a bed of coffee while in infusion all of the water and all of the coffee are infused together during the whole brew time.

Imagine that of those 60 grams about 12 grams were dissolved and brought into the liquid coffee. 
In case of a percolation like a pour-over, not all of the water that you pour in ends up in the brew. Typically about 2 grams per gram of coffee get absorbed by the ground coffee so in the resulting brew we have 12 grams of coffee dissolved in about 880 grams of water. In case of a French-Press that extraction is now dissolved into a thousand grams of water all involved in the brewing process and those solubles are distributed amongst the whole thing. That makes that brew weaker even though it's
the same extraction 
If you want a similar extraction and a similar strength you would use more coffee in the infusions brews.
Great starting points for any pour-over are about 60 grams a litre. For any infusion brew about 75 grams.

Of course, this can be adjusted according to your preferences and later updates to the app might fix that.
