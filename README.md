# 100DaysOfSwiftUICoffeeApps
Repurposing the 100 days of SwiftUI to create little functional coffee apps.  
I wanted to practice SwiftUI with the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course by Paul Hudson and at the same time have some fun and do something 'useful'.

## Coffee Brewing Ratios
This little coffee app has been inspired by James Hoffman YouTube video about [Brewing Ratios](https://youtu.be/ipB6P1uzNYM).
The main question this app will answer is: 
In terms of filter coffee like a pour-over or an AeroPress, how much coffee should I use?
