# Guess The Coffee Country

I wanted to practice SwiftUI with the 100 Days of SwiftUI course by Paul Hudson and at the same time have some fun and do something useful.
This little coffee app has been inspired by the coffees offered by [The Barn](https://thebarn.de/pages/coffee-card-archive) in Berlin
